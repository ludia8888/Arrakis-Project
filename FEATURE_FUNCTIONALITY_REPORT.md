# Arrakis Project Feature Functionality Report

## Executive Summary

This report verifies the actual functionality of the advertised features in the Arrakis Project. The testing was conducted on July 12, 2025, to determine which features are truly operational versus just having code implementations.

### Overall Status: **Mostly Code-Only Implementation**

- **14.3%** of features are fully working (1 out of 7)
- **71.4%** of features are partially implemented (5 out of 7) 
- **14.3%** of features are not working (1 out of 7)

## Feature-by-Feature Analysis

### 1. GraphQL Deep Linking ❌ (Not Running)
**Status:** PARTIAL - Code exists but service not running

**Evidence:**
- 229 Python files contain GraphQL-related code
- No GraphQL service running on expected port 4000
- GraphQL implementation exists in `/ontology-management-service/api/graphql/`
- **Verdict:** Feature is implemented in code but not accessible to users

### 2. Redis SmartCache ✅ (WORKING)
**Status:** WORKING - Fully functional

**Evidence:**
- Redis server running on port 6379 (confirmed with `redis-cli ping`)
- SmartCache implementation found in 29 files
- Core implementation at `/ontology-management-service/shared/cache/smart_cache.py`
- **Verdict:** This is the only fully functional advertised feature

### 3. Jaeger Tracing ⚠️ (Running but Unused)
**Status:** PARTIAL - UI accessible but no application traces

**Evidence:**
- Jaeger UI accessible at http://localhost:16686
- Docker container `oms-jaeger` is running
- Only 1 service visible (jaeger-all-in-one itself)
- No application services sending traces
- **Verdict:** Infrastructure is running but not integrated with application

### 4. Time Travel Queries ❌ (Code Only)
**Status:** PARTIAL - Code exists but endpoints not accessible

**Evidence:**
- 24 files contain time travel implementation
- Time travel routes defined in `/api/v1/time_travel_routes.py`
- API endpoints return 404 or authentication errors
- **Verdict:** Feature implemented but not exposed through running services

### 5. @unfoldable Documents ❌ (Code Only)
**Status:** PARTIAL - Code exists with test endpoints only

**Evidence:**
- 11 files contain unfoldable document logic
- Test endpoints exist in `/api/test_endpoints.py`
- No production API endpoints available
- Core implementation at `/core/documents/unfoldable.py`
- **Verdict:** Experimental feature with no production endpoints

### 6. @metadata Frames ❌ (Code Only)
**Status:** PARTIAL - Code exists but no production endpoints

**Evidence:**
- 22 files contain metadata frame implementation
- Dedicated module at `/core/documents/metadata_frames.py`
- No accessible API endpoints
- **Verdict:** Feature implemented in code but not exposed to users

### 7. Vector Embeddings ❌ (Stub Only)
**Status:** NOT WORKING - Mostly stub implementation

**Evidence:**
- 1162 files reference embeddings (false positive from general search)
- Main implementation is a stub at `/shared/embedding_stub.py`
- No embedding service running on any port
- **Verdict:** Feature is not implemented beyond placeholder code

## Current Running Services

### Actually Running:
1. **Mock Services** (ports 8010-8012):
   - Mock OMS service
   - Mock User service  
   - Mock Audit service
   
2. **Redis** (port 6379) - Fully functional

3. **Monitoring Stack**:
   - Prometheus (port 9091)
   - Grafana (port 3000)
   - Jaeger (port 16686)
   - Pyroscope (port 4040)
   - Various exporters

### NOT Running:
1. **GraphQL Service** (expected on port 4000)
2. **Real OMS Service** (would have time travel, unfoldable docs, etc.)
3. **Embedding Service** (no port allocated)
4. **TerminusDB** (expected on port 6363)
5. **PostgreSQL** (expected on port 5432)

## Recommendations

### To Make Features Functional:

1. **Start the Real OMS Service:**
   ```bash
   cd ontology-management-service
   python bootstrap/app.py
   ```

2. **Start GraphQL Service:**
   ```bash
   cd ontology-management-service
   python api/graphql/main.py
   ```

3. **Configure Jaeger Integration:**
   - Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation to application services
   - Configure services to send traces to Jaeger

4. **Enable Production Endpoints:**
   - Time Travel: Mount time_travel_routes in the main app
   - Unfoldable/Metadata: Create production API endpoints

5. **Implement Vector Embeddings:**
   - Replace stub with actual embedding service
   - Consider using OpenAI embeddings or local models

## Conclusion

The Arrakis Project has extensive code implementations for its advertised features, but **most features are not actually accessible or functional** in the current deployment. Only Redis SmartCache is fully working. The project appears to be in a development state where features are implemented in code but not properly deployed or exposed through running services.

To deliver on the advertised features, the project needs:
- Proper service orchestration (docker-compose or similar)
- Production configurations for all services
- API endpoint exposure for implemented features
- Integration between services (especially for tracing)

**Current State:** The project is more of a code repository with feature implementations rather than a running system with functional features.
