# Step 3: Silent Failures Fixed

## Summary

Fixed critical silent failure anti-patterns where exceptions were being caught and `return None` was hiding actual errors. This prevented proper error handling, retry logic, and made debugging impossible.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `core/integrations/iam_service_client_with_fallback.py`

#### Added Custom Exception Hierarchy
```python
class ServiceUnavailableError(Exception):
    """Raised when service is unavailable (circuit breaker open, network down)"""
    pass

class ServiceTimeoutError(Exception):
    """Raised when service request times out"""
    pass

class IAMServiceError(Exception):
    """General IAM service error"""
    pass
```

#### Fixed `get_user_info()` Method
**Before**: Silent failure returning None
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to get user info: {e}")
    self._record_failure()
    return None  # ❌ Silent failure!
```

**After**: Explicit exception handling
```python
except httpx.TimeoutError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Timeout getting user info for {user_id}: {e}")
    self._record_failure()
    raise ServiceTimeoutError(f"IAM service timeout after {self.timeout}s") from e
    
except httpx.RequestError as e:
    logger.error(f"Network error getting user info for {user_id}: {e}")
    self._record_failure()
    raise ServiceUnavailableError(f"Cannot reach IAM service: {e}") from e
```

Key improvements:
- ✅ Different exceptions for different error types (timeout vs network vs validation)
- ✅ Proper logging levels (warning for retriable, error for failures)
- ✅ Exception chaining with `from e` to preserve stack trace
- ✅ Only returns None for legitimate "not found" (404) cases

#### Fixed `health_check()` Method
**Before**: Silent failure with pass
```python
except Exception:
    pass  # ❌ Silent failure!
```

**After**: Explicit error tracking
```python
except httpx.TimeoutError as e:
    logger.debug(f"Health check timeout: {e}")
    health_status["last_error"] = "Timeout"
    
except httpx.RequestError as e:
    logger.debug(f"Health check network error: {e}")
    health_status["last_error"] = f"Network error: {type(e).__name__}"
```

### 2. `middleware/auth_middleware_msa.py`

#### Fixed Token Validation
**Before**: Silent failure returning None
```python
except ValueError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Token validation failed: {e}")
    return None  # ❌ Silent failure!
```

**After**: Re-raise validation errors
```python
except ValueError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Token validation failed: {e}")
    raise  # ✅ Re-raise - don't hide validation errors
```

## Impact on Callers

Callers must now handle specific exceptions instead of checking for None:

```python
# Before (problematic)
user_info = await iam_client.get_user_info(user_id)
if user_info is None:
    # Is user not found? Network error? Timeout? We don't know!
    return {"error": "Failed to get user"}

# After (explicit)
try:
    user_info = await iam_client.get_user_info(user_id)
    if user_info is None:
        # Only None for 404 - user genuinely not found
        return {"error": "USER_NOT_FOUND"}
    # Process user
except ServiceTimeoutError:
    # Retry with backoff
    return {"error": "TIMEOUT", "retry": True}
except ServiceUnavailableError:
    # Circuit breaker or network issue
    return {"error": "SERVICE_DOWN", "retry": True}
except ValueError:
    # Bad input - don't retry
    return {"error": "INVALID_REQUEST", "retry": False}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Error Diagnosis**: Specific exceptions tell us exactly what went wrong
2. **Proper Retry Logic**: Can retry network errors but not validation errors
3. **Accurate Metrics**: Can track different failure types separately
4. **Easier Debugging**: Full stack traces preserved with exception chaining
5. **No Silent Data Loss**: Errors are visible and must be handled

## Remaining Work

Other files still have silent failures that need fixing:
- `core/iam/iam_integration.py` - Returns empty dict on errors
- `core/integrations/iam_service_client.py` - Has similar patterns
- Various middleware files with `except: pass` patterns

## Testing

All tests passed (6/6) demonstrating:
- Silent failures were correctly identified
- Impact of hiding errors was shown (wrong business decisions)
- Fixed implementation handles all error cases explicitly
- Dependent services can now make correct retry/fail decisions
