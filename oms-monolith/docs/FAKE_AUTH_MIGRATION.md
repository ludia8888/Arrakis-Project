# Fake Authentication Migration Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration of fake authentication code to test-only fixtures with proper environment guards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Protection Added
- **File**: `api/gateway/auth.py`
- Added environment check that throws error if used in production
- Added deprecation warnings and logging
- Original mock function preserved but protected

### 2. Test Fixtures Created
- **Location**: `tests/fixtures/auth/mock_auth.py`
- Clean mock authentication for testing
- Multiple user types (admin, developer, reviewer, viewer)
- Dependency injection support for FastAPI testing

### 3. Test Route Registration
- **File**: `tests/fixtures/test_routes.py`
- Conditional registration based on environment
- Groups test routes under `/test` prefix
- Clear separation from production routes

### 4. Environment Configuration
- **File**: `core/config/environment.py`
- Centralized environment management
- Clear boolean flags for feature toggles
- Logging of environment state on startup

### 5. Import Updates
All routes using fake auth updated to use real auth:
- `api/v1/schema_generation/endpoints.py`
- `api/v1/struct_types/endpoints.py`
- `api/v1/semantic_types/endpoints.py`

## Current State

### Production Safety ✅
- Fake auth throws error in production environment
- Test routes not registered in production
- All active routes use real authentication middleware

### Test Environment Support ✅
- Mock auth available via dependency injection
- Test routes accessible under `/test` prefix
- Clear warnings when using test features

### Dead Code Identified
- GraphQL modules importing non-existent auth functions
- These modules are not registered and should be cleaned up

## Environment Variables

Set `ENV` to control behavior:
- `production` - All test features disabled
- `staging` - Limited test features
- `development` - Test features enabled (default)
- `test` - Full test mode
- `local` - Same as development

## Usage in Tests

```python
# In test files
from tests.fixtures.auth.mock_auth import get_test_user_dependency
from middleware.auth_middleware import get_current_user

# Override auth for testing
app.dependency_overrides[get_current_user] = get_test_user_dependency("admin")

# Run tests...

# Clean up
app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

## Next Steps

1. Remove dead GraphQL code that references non-existent auth functions
2. Consider removing `api/gateway/auth.py` entirely once all tests are migrated
3. Add integration tests to verify environment guards work correctly
