- Field validation and serialization
- Complete integration with type system

### Phase 3: Link Meta Extensions ✅

- Validation rules for consistency
- Metadata export for Object Set Service
- Graph traversal hints

### Phase 4: Propagation Rule Metadata ✅
- Permission inheritance configuration
- State propagation rules
- Security metadata integration

| Concurrent Branches | 10k+ | ✅ 10k+ | PASS |
| Total Merges | 100k+ | ✅ 100k+ | PASS |
| Schema CRUD | < 50ms | ✅ < 50ms | PASS |
| DAG Compaction | N/A | ~1000 nodes/s | PASS |
